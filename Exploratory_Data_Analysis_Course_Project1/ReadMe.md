#Exploratory Data Analysis- Course Project 1

##Repository for the course project 1. Currently there are 8 files for the Course Project: 
1. 4 R scripts.
2. 4 png images.

To run this script you need to to the following:
A. Download the scripts (plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, plot4.R).
B. Download the data file "household_power_consumption" from "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip;"
C. Extract the file "household_power_consumption" working R directory.
D. Run the scripts.

###Note: Due to the precribed image size of 480x480 the legends may appear dislocated in some plots. None of the settings can fix this. Thanks!!
